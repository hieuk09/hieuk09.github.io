<p>
I'm Hieu, just another software engineer out there in the Internet. I'm
currently working for Saigon Office of TINYpulse, a company based in Silicon Valley.

<p>
I'm interested in every aspect of programming, but concentrate in backend and game.
I usually blog about coding, and sometimes also writes about books, manga and other
random stuffs.
