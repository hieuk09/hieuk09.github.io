ISO is dependent on the camera censor because the digital camera noise look very
fake, not as real as the film one. Therefore, it's totally depend on each
camera.

Some advice on choosing ISO:

- Most of the case, choose the lowest ISO so you can have good tone and color
- When taking picture of hillock or object with rough interface, you should choose
high ISO (400-800)
- When taking portrait picture, ISO will be around 160-200 (if the person has
    good face - no blackhead)
