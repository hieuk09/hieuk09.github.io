There are three things that I try after reading this chapter:

- Store everything in a source version control: I find this particularly useful.
After moving everything from my MacOS note to my daily log to a git repo, it's
much easier to revert an error I made, or trace back what I did in specific day
now.

- Write everything using a single editor: together with the above, now I code,
  note and writing thing in a single editor now. This is really useful for
  editting and manipulating text, as I find myself more proficient with that in
  vim than in MacOS note application.

- Using code generator for repeating tasks: I'm experimenting with this. I hope
that I can save more of my time for actually implementing the business logic
than writing code that machine can write.
